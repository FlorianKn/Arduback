Goal: Improve the posture of people.  
Therefore: Use an Arduino UNO R3, stretch sensor, vibration motor, bluetooth sensor and an Android App.  
App and Arduino communicate via bluetooth.  
Java and Arduino code is located in this repo.  
## App
* Receive data of strecht sensor
* Determine if posture is correct on the received data
* Store data to show history
* Give user feedback if posture is not correct, use vibration motor
